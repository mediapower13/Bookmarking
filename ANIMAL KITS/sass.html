        The web has been around for more than 25 years now, experiencing euphoric
early expansion, an economic-driven bust, an innovation-driven rebirth, and
constant evolution along the way. One thing is certain: the web as a communication and commercial medium is here to stay. Not only that, it has found
its way onto devices such as smartphones, tablets, TVs, and more. There have
never been more opportunities to put web design know-how to use.
Through my experience teaching web design courses and workshops, I’ve
had the opportunity to meet people of all backgrounds who are interested
in learning how to build web pages.

“I’ve been a print designer for 17 years, and now I am feeling pressure to provide web design services.”
“I’ve been a programmer for years, but I want shift my skills to web development because there are good job opportunities in my area.”
“I tinkered with web pages in high school and I think it might be something
I’d like to do for a living.”
“I’ve made a few sites using themes in WordPress, but I’d like to expand my
skills and create custom sites for small businesses.”
